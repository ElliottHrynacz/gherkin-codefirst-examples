## Gherkin vs Code-First Test Automation Examples
This repository showcases examples comparing Gherkin-based test automation with a code-first approach. The goal is to highlight the differences between these two approaches and demonstrate why a code-first methodology is often more efficient, maintainable, and scalable in automation testing.

## Overview
In this repository, you'll find a series of examples showing how to approach test automation using both Gherkin and a code-first approach. The examples primarily focus on test automation for web applications, leveraging tools such as Playwright.

By comparing these approaches, you'll see how Gherkin-based testing introduces extra layers of abstraction and complexity, whereas the code-first approach offers a more direct, flexible, and efficient way to write and maintain tests.

## Whatâ€™s Inside?
### Gherkin-based examples
Feature files written in Gherkin syntax with corresponding step definitions to illustrate how test scenarios can be structured in Gherkin.

### Code-first examples
The same tests written directly in code (using Playwright) without the need for Gherkin syntax or step definitions.
